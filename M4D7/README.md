# Module 4 Day 7 - Homework Brief

### Conditional Rendering

#### In these exercises you'll apply your skills creating new rendering conditions for the Strivestaurant project.</em>

**To Do:**

- [x] **1.** Transform DishComments functional component into a class based one.
      <br>

- [x] **2.** In the ReservationForm component make the Form actually visible just after clicking on the h2 above it (use the component state!).
      <br>

- [x] **3.** Change MyNavBar component in a class-based one; create a constructor and log a message in the console as the component initializes.
      <br>

- [ ] **4.** In the DishComments component use the ternary operator to show a piece of text instead of the ListGroup if the dish prop is a falsy value.
      <br>

- [ ] **5.** In the Home component, hide the DishComments component with a short-circuit operator if the selected dish name is "Amatriciana".
      <br>

- [ ] **6.** In the Home component, show an Alert component instead of the ReservationForm if even a single a comment of the selected dish has a rating below 5.
      <br>

- [ ] **7.** In the Home component, show an Alert component instead of the
      ReservationForm if even a single a comment of the selected dish has a
      rating below 5.
      <br>

- [ ] **8.** In Home.jsx give a "header" prop to the Reservations component. If
      present, this component should display it instead of the generic
      'RESERVATIONS' in its h3.
      <br>

- [ ] **9.** In the Home component use a ternary operator to replace the text inside
      the h1 and the p tags above the carousel with the values of the props
      "newTitle" and "newPayoff" respectively, if present.
      <br>

- [ ] **10.** Change the "Strive for food" text in the MyNavBar component to "The
    perfect place for pasta lovers" if the prop title has a value of
    "Strivestaurant".

<details><summary># Getting Started with Create React App</summary>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
